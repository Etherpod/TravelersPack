Gives you a placeable backpack to store items in. Now you can transport all of your items with ease!

To place the backpack, stand on a solid surface and press the button shown on the top-left button prompt. If you're currently interacting with something, you won't be able to place it down.

You can store items in it by holding them and interacting with the backpack. When you have multiple items stored, you can cycle between them using the left and right tool buttons.

The backpack has a map marker in case you leave it somewhere by accident. If it gets in the way or you like the idea of being able to lose all of your items, you can turn it off in the mod settings.
